# Dispatch-script
Small script I wrote for my brother to use at work, takes a client's office address and runs it against a list of techs and their home addresses to generate a list of travel time/distance to the clients office for all their techs to determine the preferable order of who should handle the call.

Not super experienced with Python or Google Maps API so bit of a learning experience and could use some further optimization I may do at a later date just for the practice.

Included some .bat files to install the dependencies and to actually execute the script just to make it very simple to get going with it

Add names and addresses to addresses file as desired, create APIKEY file with your api key from GCP, and then run the dispatch.bat for Windows or execute the dispatch.py file however you feel like.
