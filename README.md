# Dispatch-script
Small script I wrote for my brother, takes a client's office address and runs it against a list of techs and their home addresses to generate a list of travel time/distance to the clients office for all their techs to determine the preferable order of who should handle the call

Install python3.10.4, when installing python make sure to check the box for adding it to the PATH

Run install dependencies script to ensure all required packages are installed

Add names and addresses to addresses file, create APIKEY file with your api key from GCP, and then run the dispatch.bat for Windows or execute the dispatch.py file however you feel like.
